#1 - Issue with triliteral and multiple authors
Looking at the idea of having a join table to manage the many to
many relation (authors/books) we need to determine how the triliteral
used to identify the author (especially for Dewey decimal) is assigned
if more than an author exists. Should there be a 'first author' field
in the join table?
